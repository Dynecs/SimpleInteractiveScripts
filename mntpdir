#  See README file for Installation Guide.
#
#  Interactive tool that helps you create a mount point directory (MPD)
#  for external mass storage devices (USB, SSD, etc..). Once the MPD
#  is created, mount your device to it and it will appear in your file
#  manager for easy accesibility.
#
#  -- Made this tool for learning purposes and to automate the task of
#     making a MPD for mass storage devices.
#  -- Updates of this script are under development to allow use of
#     the subtools within and to increase functionality.
#  -- REPO: https://github.com/Dynecs/SimpleInteractiveScripts.git
