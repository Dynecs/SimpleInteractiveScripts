# The intent of this repo is to provide simple scripts to help have a better understanding
# of how they are built and how beneficial they can be. Scripting helps automate small or
# big everyday tasks, and it's crucial to understand their structure to start building your
# own and implementing them into your daily workflow. These scripts will be more beneficial
# to folks new to this field but experienced authors are more than welcomed to take anything
# you find useful here and build on it yourselves.
